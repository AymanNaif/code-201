# JavaScript
## Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming
#### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
### How to achieve our goals ?
#### at first you need to start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
1. #### DEFINE THE GOAL : you need to define the task you want to achieve.
2. #### DESIGN THE SCRIPT : To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle.
3. #### CODE EACH STEP : Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.


## How javascript makes web pages more interactive :
1. ACCESS CONTENT:You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from anHTML page.
2. MODIFY CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. 
3. PROGRAM RULES: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
4. REACT TO EVENTS: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

## WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 
Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps. 
1. DEFINE THE GOAL: First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve. 
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT: To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. 
3. CODE EACH STEP: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. 

## EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE Example :

var color = 'beige'; 

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE  EXAMPLE : 

var area = 3 * 2; 

## OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers.  You may remember some from math class.

## Functions
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: 

* The name of the function.

* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

For example :

### COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA
#### programmers create a very different kind of model, especially for computers. Programmers make these models using data. That is not as strange or as scary as it sounds because the data is all the computer needs in order to follow the instructions you give it to carry out its tasks.

### OBJECTS & PROPERTIES
#### OBJECTS : In computer programming, each physica l thing in the world can be represented as an object. There are two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car.
#### In computer programming, each physica l thing in the world can be represented as an object. There are two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car. Each object can have its own( Properties, Events, Methods) Together they create a working model of that object.
#### PROPERTIES :Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object.

### EVENTS
#### There are common ways in which people interact with each type of object. 
#### Programmers choose which events they respond to. When a specific event happens, that event can be used to trigger a specific section of the code. Scripts often use different events to trigger different types of functionality. So a script will state which events the programmer wants to respond to, and what part of the script should be run when each of those events occur.
