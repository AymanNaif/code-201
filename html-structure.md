# HTML
## Chapter 1: Structure
#### at the first we can say HTML pages are text documents, it's can have any contant that you want to build up the page structure such as (text,images,links and more ..).
#### for that we use something it call *tags* , the tags are that characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning it can be heading (<h1> </h1>) or paraghraph (<p> </p>) or images or any contant **Tags are often referred to as elements.**
#### Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
#### Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
#### inside any opning tags we can put something it call *Attributes*, the attributes can tell us about the proparites of the elements and we can control it, it's require a name and a value.
### **note** that To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

## Chapter 8: Extra Markup
#### it was there an HTML evoulution it started ar xhtml until now it's HTML5 so now we use *DOCTYPES* to tell tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
#### in HTML we can add comments to our code by (<!-*- -*-> *"remove *"*) that can give you or other devloper to understand the codes or keep notes.
#### as well we can use *id or class attributes* to identify elements that we can change it's propariteis next by *CSS or JS*.
### Notes:
- #### The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- #### <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
-  #### The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
-  #### Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©
