# HTML
## Chapter 1: Structure
#### at the first we can say HTML pages are text documents, it's can have any contant that you want to build up the page structure such as (text,images,links and more ..).
#### for that we use something it call *tags* , the tags are that characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning it can be heading (<h1> </h1>) or paraghraph (<p> </p>) or images or any contant **Tags are often referred to as elements.**
#### Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
#### Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
#### inside any opning tags we can put something it call *Attributes*, the attributes can tell us about the proparites of the elements and we can control it, it's require a name and a value.
### **note** that To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
