- #### Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- #### Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
- #### Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms

### Unordered Lists

### *note* : Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)

#### The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the <dl> element you willusually see pairs of <dt>(This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term) and <dd> elements (This is used to contain the definition)
