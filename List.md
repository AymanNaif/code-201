# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
## HTML (Chapter 3: Lists)
### Lists type :
#### there's three type of lists :
- #### Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- #### Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
- #### Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms

### Ordered Lists
#### The ordered list is created with the <ol> element, 
### Unordered Lists
#### The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
  
### *note* : Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)

#### The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the <dl> element you willusually see pairs of <dt>(This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term) and <dd> elements (This is used to contain the definition)

### Nested Lists
#### You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

## CSS (chapter 13: Boxex)

### Box Dimensions
By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties
###### Limiting Width
min-width, max-width
###### Limiting Height
min-height, max-height
###### Overflowing Content

The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have
one of two values: 
1. hidden 
2. scroll

### Border, Margin & Padding
1. border: Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
2. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
3. Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
### Border Width
thin
medium
thick

### Border Style
solid
dotted
dashed
double
groove
inset
outset
hidden / none
and you can color it 
###### Hiding Boxes
visibility has tow attribute 
hidden
visible
# ARRAYS
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array).
The values are assigned to the
array inside a pair of square
brackets, and each value is
separated by a comma. The
values in the array do not need
to be the same data type, so you
can store a string, a number and
a Boolean all in the same array.

example 
var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom']; 
## VALU ES IN ARRAYS
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

# SWITCH STATEMENTS If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect,
it tries to make sense of the operation rather
than report an error. 
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 
###### TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING 
If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect,
it tries to make sense of the operation rather
than report an error. 
###### CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE
Because the presence of an object or array can
be considered truthy, it is often used to check
for the existence of an element within a page. 

# loops 
###### USING FOR LOOPS
A for loop is often used to loop
through the items in an array.
In this example, the scores for
each round of a test are stored in
an array called scores. 
###### USING do WHILE LOOPS
The key difference between
a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e
loop is that the statements in
the code block come before the
condition. This means that those
statements are run once whether
or not the condition is met.
