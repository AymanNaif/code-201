## The Problem Domain
##### What is the hardest thing about writing code?
##### - Learning a new technology
##### - Naming things
##### - Testing your code
##### - Debugging
##### - Fixing bugs
##### - Making software maintainable

##### with the simple application it was so easy to understand, the focus was taken off of the problem domain and put instead on the technology.
##### By creating a familiar problem domain, we will found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is **very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.**
##### The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.
##### was easily able to learn that problem domain and because of it, I was able to write the code very easily as well.

##### If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

##### 1. Make the problem domain easier
##### 2. Get better at understanding the problem domain
##### You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.
######  It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking you understand enough of the problem to get started coding it.  


## Chapter 3: “Object Literals”
### WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
##### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names
##### IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES , IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS

## Chapter 5: “Document Object Model”
##### The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

### Node Type :
##### - THE DOCUMENT(Root) NODE 
##### - ELEMENT NODES
##### - ATTRIBUTE NODES
##### - TEXT NODES

### WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE
##### Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
##### 1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
##### 2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

#### STEP 1: ACCESS THE ELEMENTS

###### In th book there's a lot of details about how and what you can do with all of this selectors !  so that you can access the eleements and then make them to do function or action or anything else ..

#### STEP 2: WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS

### WHITESPACE NODES
##### Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements
