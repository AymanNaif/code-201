### Adding Images
#### To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
- #### src : This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.
- #### alt : This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
- #### title : You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image.

### Height & Width of Images 
- #### height : This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
- #### width : This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
