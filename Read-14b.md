# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
## What makes the perfect team?
To have a great team, there is no surefire recipe for success. A combination of solid leadership, communication, and access to good resources contribute to productive collaboration, but it all comes down to having people who understand each other and work well together.
## What are the 5 roles of an effective team?
Here are five roles of an effective team: 
* Leaders.
* Creative Director. 
* Facilitator.
* Coach.
* Member. 
All these are essential components of a team, but they need not be exclusive.

## What do good leaders do?
Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. Yet, while leaders set the direction, they must also use management skills to guide their people to the right destination, in a smooth and efficient way.


Project Aristotlgies researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departmentsâ€™ goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a teamâ€™s success.

Project Aristotles researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an unwritten rule or when they explained certain things as part of the team culture.Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their groupâ€™s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.

Which group would you rather join?

In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one. â€˜â€˜Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals,â€™â€™ the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010. â€˜â€˜We have used the statistical approach they developed for individual intelligence to systematically measure the intelligence of groups.â€™â€™ Put differently, the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I.â€‰Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.

To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses; others kept describing the same ideas in different words. Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the groupâ€™s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. Some groups easily divvied up the buying; others couldnâ€™t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.

What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the â€˜â€˜goodâ€™â€™ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a groupâ€™s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. â€˜â€˜Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,â€™â€™ said Anita Woolley, the studyâ€™s lead author. â€˜â€˜Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyoneâ€™s relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.â€™â€™

As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as â€˜â€˜equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.â€™â€™ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. â€˜â€˜As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,â€™â€™ Woolley said. â€˜â€˜But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.

Second, the good teams all had high â€˜â€˜average social sensitivityâ€™â€™ â€” a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of peopleâ€™s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling â€” an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolleyâ€™s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the groupâ€™s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. Thereâ€™s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and thereâ€™s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.


In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one anotherâ€™s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.

Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like â€˜â€˜conversational turn-takingâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜average social sensitivityâ€™â€™ as aspects of whatâ€™s known as psychological safety â€” a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a â€˜â€˜shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.â€™â€™ Psychological safety is â€˜â€˜a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,â€™â€™ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. â€˜â€˜It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.

When Rozovsky and her Google colleagues encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. One engineer, for instance, had told researchers that his team leader was â€˜â€˜direct and straightforward, which creates a safe space for you to take risks.â€™â€™ That team, researchers estimated, was among Googleâ€™s accomplished groups. By contrast, another engineer had told the researchers that his â€˜â€˜team leader has poor emotional control.â€™â€™ He added: â€˜â€˜He panics over small issues and keeps trying to grab control. I would hate to be driving with him being in the passenger seat, because he would keep trying to grab the steering wheel and crash the car.â€™â€™ That team, researchers presumed, did not perform well.

Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt.˜And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale,â€™â€™ Rozovsky said. â€˜â€˜Iâ€™d been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group.â€™â€™ Rozovskyâ€™s study group at Yale was draining because the norms â€” the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique â€” put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team â€” enthusiasm for one anotherâ€™s ideas, joking around and having fun â€” allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.


â€˜I might be the luckiest individual on earth,â€™â€™ Sakaguchi told me. â€˜â€˜Iâ€™m not really an engineer. I didnâ€™t study computers in college. Everyone who works for me is much smarter than I am.â€™â€™ But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result, Sakaguchi has thrived at Google. He and his wife, a teacher, have a home in San Francisco and a weekend house in the Sonoma Valley wine country. â€˜â€˜Most days, I feel like Iâ€™ve won the lottery,â€™â€™ he said.
