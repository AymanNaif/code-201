# HTML (Chpter 4: Links)
## Writing links
#### Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.

## Linking to Other Sites
#### Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of thehref attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

### Absolute URLs
#### URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted tovisit that specific page.

## Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site 
#### When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

### Rela tive URLs
#### When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name.

## Email Links
To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the < a >
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to

## Opening Links in a New Window
If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
< a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.
One of the most common
reasons a web page author
might want a link to be opened
in a new window is if it points to
another website. In such cases,
they hope the user will return
to the window containing their
site after finishing looking at the
other one.


# HTML Layout Elements
< header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
< nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
< section> - Defines a section in a document
< article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
< aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
< footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
< details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
< summary> - Defines a heading for the
Details
## CSS Flexbox Layout
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

The position Property The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

1.static
2.relative
3.fixed
4.bsolute
5.sticky
6.Position
7.Gives strict, coordinate-based control over layout.

# Functions
## What are functions in JavaScript?
A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

## How do functions work in JavaScript?
Functions are executed when they are called.   
Values can be passed into functions and used within the function. Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.

## How do you return a value from a JavaScript function?
JavaScript provides for passing one value back to the code that called it after everything in the function that needs to run has finished running. JavaScript passes a value from a function back to the code that called it by using the return statement . The value to be returned is specified in the return keyword.

## Can a function return multiple values?
A function is not restricted to return a variable, it can return zero, one, two or more values. This is the default property of python to return multiple values/variables which is not available in many other programming languages like C++ or Java.


# Pair Programming
Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.

## How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, andâ€”of course writingâ€”code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

## Why pair program?
1. Greater efficiency

It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient.

2. Engaged collaboration

When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. 

3. Learning from fellow students

Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

4. Social skills

Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.

5. Job interview readiness

A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen.

6. Work environment readiness

Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
