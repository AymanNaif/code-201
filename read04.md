# HTML (Chpter 4: Links)
## Writing links
#### Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.

## Linking to Other Sites
#### Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of thehref attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

### Absolute URLs
#### URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted tovisit that specific page.

## Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site 
#### When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

### Rela tive URLs
#### When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name.
