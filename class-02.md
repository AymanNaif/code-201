#### HTML has six level of heading start from h1 untel h6,the browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6> element is the smallest.The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly.
#### *note* : h1 is used for main headings h2 is used for subheadings.

### Paragraphs
#### To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening < p > tag and closing < /p > tag.

### Bold & Italic
#### By enclosing words in the tags < b > and < /b > we can make characters appear bold.
#### By enclosing words in the tags < i > and < /i > we can make characters appear italic.

### Superscript & Subscript
#### The < sup > element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 2<sup>2</sup>.
#### The < sub > element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>O.

#### *note* :When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.

### Line Breaks & orizontal Rules 
#### the browser will automatically show ach new paragraph or heading n a new line. But if you wanted o add a line break inside themiddle of a paragraph you can se the line break tag <br />.
#### To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.

### Strong & Emphasis
#### The use of the < strong >  element indicates that its content has strong importance.
#### The < em > element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.

### Quotations
#### The <blockquote > element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the <p> element is still used inside the <blockquote> element.
#### The <q > element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <q > element, however Internet Explorer does not — therefore many people avoid using the <q >  element.

### Abbereviations & Acronyms
#### If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr > element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.

### Citations & Definitions
#### When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the <cite > element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
#### The <dfn > element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.

### Author Details
#### The <address > element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address.

### Changes to Content
#### The < lns > element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <del > element can show text that has been deleted from it.
#### The < s > element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted). Visually the content of an < s > element will usually be displayed with a line through the center.
